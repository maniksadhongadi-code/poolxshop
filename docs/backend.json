    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability for the Customer Hub application.  \n\nThe structure segregates active and pending customers into separate collections: `/active_customers` and `/pending_customers`. This segregation simplifies security rules as each collection has distinct access requirements.\n\nAuthorization Independence: The structure does not rely on hierarchical `get()` calls. Security rules can operate independently on each document based on its attributes.\n\nQAPs Support: The segregated structure enables secure `list` operations by ensuring that rules can be applied consistently to all documents within a collection, preventing unauthorized access. No filtering is needed within the rules themselves.\n\nThe choice of separate collections avoids mixing customer status within a single collection, making rules simpler and more efficient. The structure also facilitates future expansion and feature additions without compromising data integrity or security."
